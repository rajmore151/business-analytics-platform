# Business Analytics Platform

## 🎯 Project Overview

An end-to-end analytics system designed to process, analyze, and derive actionable insights from business data. This platform demonstrates production-grade data engineering practices, SQL analytics, and business intelligence workflows.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Modern businesses generate massive amounts of transactional data but struggle to:
- Extract meaningful insights quickly
- Identify revenue patterns and customer behavior
- Make data-driven decisions with confidence
- Maintain data quality and consistency

This project solves these challenges by building a scalable analytics pipeline that transforms raw business data into strategic insights.

## 🏗️ Architecture
```
Raw Data → Data Ingestion → Data Cleaning → Storage (SQL DB) → Analytics Queries → Insights & Reports
```

## 📊 Key Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Automated loading of CSV/Excel files with validation
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive cleaning, deduplication, and error handling
- **SQL Analytics**: Business-grade queries for KPIs, trends, and segmentation
- **Modular Design**: Clean, reusable Python modules following best practices
- **Documentation**: Clear architecture and usage guidelines

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MySQL
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
